    Like the El Arroyo sign or the I Love You So Much Frog, the
    <strong>Valero&nbsp;Coming&nbsp;Soon</strong> sign has been an Austin landmark for
    years. Its hopeful message expresses an expectation of a bright future, shared by
    Austinites old and young. It is a symbol of resilience in the face of change.

<p>
    Located just north of Austin at the corner of FM 1325 and Quick Hill Rd, the
    <strong>Valero&nbsp;Coming&nbsp;Soon</strong> sign is seen by thousands of locals
    and visitors each week.
